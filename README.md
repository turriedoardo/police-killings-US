# Police Fatal Killings in the US

This project is important to me since it deals with a topical theme: the fatal shootings of the US Police during the last six years.  
In fact, since the first January 2015, the Washington Post has started to register all the victims of the police officers and built a data frame with pieces of information for each case: personal details (like victim's gender, race and age) but also social information such as the median household or the percentage of people that completed the high school in the given city.  

Through my exploratory data analysis, I looked for some insights and underlined the main factors related to the number of kills, the most dangerous cities, the presence of a racial bias, and many more.
